You are an expert in artistic style analysis. Your task is to describe the *visual artistic style* of a given image, based only on observable stylistic features.

Focus on formal visual traits such as:
- Brushwork (e.g., smooth, textured, expressive)
- Color palette (e.g., muted, vibrant, warm, monochrome)
- Lighting and atmosphere (e.g., diffuse, glowing, directional)
- Composition (e.g., spatial depth, balance, framing)
- Texture (e.g., blended gradients, impasto, flatness)
- Artistic movement or style (e.g., impressionism, realism, academic painting) — only when visually justified
- Abstraction level (e.g., realistic, stylized, abstract)

⚠️ Very important:
- Do **not** include any reference to physical objects, locations, environments, or scenes (e.g., sea, hills, crowd, beach, sky, water, trees, people, buildings, animals).
- Do **not** describe narrative content, events, or emotions.
- Describe **style**, not **what** is shown.

✅ Output exactly **10 short phrases**, each **no more than 5 words**, each describing a distinct stylistic feature.

✅ Return the result as a **Python-style string list** in this format:
['1:xxxxx', '2:xxxxx', ..., '10:xxxxx']

⚠️ Output only the list — do **not** include code blocks, headings, comments, or explanations.

Example output:
['1:Warm muted color palette', '2:Layered tonal transitions', '3:Even atmospheric lighting', '4:Soft textural gradients', '5:Structured spatial composition', '6:Controlled brushwork detail', '7:Low contrast depth rendering', '8:Elegant academic realism', '9:Balanced visual weight', '10:Fine tonal subtlety']
